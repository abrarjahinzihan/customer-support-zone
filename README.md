# What is the difference between State and Props?
-Think of props like parameters you pass to a function - they're data that gets passed down from a parent component to a child component, and the child can't change them. State, on the other hand, is like a component's personal memory - it's data that the component manages itself and can update over time. Props come from outside (immutable), while state is internal (mutable).

# What is the useState hook, and how does it work?

-The useState hook adds state management to functional components in React. It gives us two things: the current state value and a function to update it. Whenever we call the update function, React changes the state and automatically re-renders the component to show the new value. It's like giving us component a memory that can change over time.

# How can you share state between components in React?
